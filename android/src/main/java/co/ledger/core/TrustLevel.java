 * Level of trust for transactions.
 *
 * A transaction is pending when it’s not mined yet.
 *
 * A transaction is unstrusted when it belongs to a block that is not 5-block old yet (0—4).
 *
 * A transaction is trusted when it belongs to a block that is at least 5-block old.
 *
 * A transaction is dropped when it has been removed from the block it was originally in. That might
 * happen if the block was dropped by peers while a reorganization was happening, for instance.
